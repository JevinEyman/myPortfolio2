			<p>I would like to take a moment and tell you a few interesting things about myself.  I am an avid runner and triathlete.  I have completed five full marathons and one Ironman triathlon.  I am hard working and extremely motivated to be the best version of myself everyday. I am currently working as an EMT/ Ocean Lifeguard and I am pursuing a career in Web Development.  Being a part of a revolution in the technology industry excites me.  I feel like the possibilities are endless.  Thank you for your time.</p>
